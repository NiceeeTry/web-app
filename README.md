# Final Rest Api Project

## Project Set Up
To run the backend server run the following code:

`make install`

After installation of all the necessary packages run:

`make run`

In case the `make` utility is not installed on your PC, 
run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then `python app.py`

To run the frontend part run:

`make npm` and then `make frontrun`

if there is no make utility, run 

`npm install` and `npm start` in the 'client' directory.

The frontend part should be runned in the separate terminal window.

## Testing 
To run the test use the `make test` command or `python test_api.py` from the root directory.


## Words to Quanti team ðŸ«¡

Dear Quantori team,

I would like to share a little feedback throughout the course. 
First of all, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the entire Quantori team for the opportunity to learn from you. Thank you for creating such a project as Quantori Academy. I've learned a lot in the last 3 months. 

The main key aspects that I would like to mention are `materials, support, and attentiveness to students.`

`Materials `
You provide very cool materials for learning Python and programming in general. The whole course is structured and follows a logical sequence, so it is much easier to understand the next lesson using knowledge from previous ones.

`Support`
The Python school course is interactive. Every student can ask any question in Slack and will be answered as soon as possible. I myself have used this opportunity more than once and it helps not to spend a lot of time searching for an answer but to concentrate on the right tasks. 
The first time I was surprised by the speed the questions were answered)

`Attentiveness to students`
Here I would like to note how you make advances to students on various issues.
Your team is open to feedback, and if a student needs something, you adjust to their circumstances. For example, there was not enough information on a certain topic and you added a lecture for Monday. Or we can't meet the deadline for tasks and you add time to the deadline.

I really liked this course.
As I said before, I have learned a lot from you. 

Thank you for your knowledge, for your time, and effort.
